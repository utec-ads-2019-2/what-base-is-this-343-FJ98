/* 343 - What Base Is This?
 * In positional notation we know the position of a digit indicates the weight of that digit toward the
 * value of a number. For example, in the base 10 number 362 we know that 2 has the weight 10^0, 6 has the weight 10^1,
 * and 3 has the weight 10^2, yielding the value 3x10^2+ 6x10^1+ 2x10^0, or just 300 + 60 + 2.
 * The same mechanism is used for numbers expressed in other bases. While most people
 * assume the numbers they encounter everyday are expressed using base 10, we know that other bases are possible.
 * In particular, the number 362 in base 9 or base 14 represents a totally different value than 362 in base 10
 * For this problem your program will presented with a sequence of pairs of integers.  Letâ€™s call the members of a
 * pairX and Y. What your program is to do is determine the smallest base for X and the smallest base for Y
 * (likely different from that forX) so that X and Y represent the same value.
 * Consider, for example, the integers 12 and 5.  Certainly these are not equal if base 10 is used for each.
 * But suppose 12 was a base 3 number and 5 was a base 6 number? 12 base 3 = 1x3^1 + 2x3^0, or 5 base 10, and certainly
 * 5 in any base is equal to 5 base 10. So 12 and 5 can be equal, if you select the right bases for each of them.
 *
 * Input:
 * On each line of the input data there will be a pair of integers,X and Y, separated by one or more blanks;
 * leading and trailing blanks may also appear on each line, are are to be ignored. The bases associated with X and Y
 * will be between 1 and 36 (inclusive), and as noted above, need not be the same for X and Y. In representing these
 * numbers the digits 0 through 9 have their usual decimal interpretations. The upper case alphabetic characters A
 * through Z represent digits with values 10 through 35, respectively.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each pair of integers in the input display a message similar to those shown in the examples shown below.
 * Of course if the two integers cannot be equal regardless of the assumed base for each, then print an appropriate
 * message; a suitable illustration is given in the examples */
